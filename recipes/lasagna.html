    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest 
        and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually 
        rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than 
        tagliatelle, made from a dough based on 
        flour and eggs, with numerous local variants.</p>

            canned tomato products, half of the parsley, 
            garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, 
            and sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the noodles</strong>: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted 
            water until they're al dente.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese layer</strong>: Mix cottage cheese, 
            Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining
             salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna</strong>: Layer the ingredients 
            according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending 
            with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna</strong>: Cover with foil and 
            bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. 
            Remove the foil and continue baking until the top 
            is golden brown.</li>
