    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Meatloaf isn't often associated with 
        healthy eating, but this recipe replaces 
        the standard ground beef with ground turkey, 
        which has less saturated fat, but still gives 
        the meatloaf delicious flavor and texture.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground turkey</li>
        <li>¾ cup crushed buttery round crackers</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Lightly grease a jelly-roll pan.</li>
        <li>Mix ground turkey, crushed crackers, milk, onion, 
            egg, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. 
            Shape mixture into a loaf and place on the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Mix ketchup, brown sugar, and Worcestershire 
            sauce in a separate bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Bake meatloaf in preheated oven for 30 minutes; 
            remove from the oven and drain off liquids. 
            Top meatloaf with ketchup topping.</li>
        <li>Return loaf to the oven and continue baking 
            until no longer pink in the center, about 
            30 minutes more; an instant-read thermometer 
            inserted into the center should read at least 
            160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
